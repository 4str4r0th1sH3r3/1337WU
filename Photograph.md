### Step 3: New Identity ?
Base on information we just gather, **fl0pfl0p5** and **m4r64r1n3** is the same person

### Step 4: URL Manipulation
Following the decoded URL led me to another page, where I encountered a URL parameter. By manipulating the parameter, I discovered that setting it to "admin" granted access to an admin dashboard, which contained the final flag.
